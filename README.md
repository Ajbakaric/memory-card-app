## Memory Card Game

Hey there! Welcome to my **Memory Card Game** project! This is a fun little app I made to test your memory skills with some of our favorite Nintendo characters. It’s fast, colorful, and works great on any device (yep, mobile too!).

Features

- **Random Card Shuffle**: Every click shuffles the cards—no two games are the same!
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of your current and best scores, so you always have a reason to beat yourself.
- **Responsive Design**: Whether you’re on your desktop, tablet, or phone, it looks awesome.

## How to Play

1. Click on a card. 
2. Don’t click the same card twice, or you’ll lose your streak!  
3. Rack up points and see if you can beat your best score.
